    ## ArcGIS Pro Professional 2025 Study Guide

    ### Purpose of the Study
    The ArcGIS Pro Professional study material focuses on applying a broad range of tools and functionality across ArcGIS to advance GIS concepts and knowledge to a project using best practices. It is designed for individuals with at least four years of applied experience in ArcGIS Pro.

    ### Target Audience
    This guide is intended for individuals with a minimum of four years of applied experience in ArcGIS Pro. They should be proficient in best practices and the uses of ArcGIS, demonstrating the ability to apply advanced GIS concepts to design and implement workflows, troubleshoot, and define and complete complex GIS projects. Typical roles may include GIS Specialist, GIS/Geospatial Analyst, Senior GIS Analyst, and GIS Manager.

    ### Candidate Qualifications
    A candidate should be capable of performing the following tasks:
    
    - Apply and interpret fundamental spatial statistics (spatial distribution of the data). (Use the [PySAL](https://pysal.org/) package for spatial statistics)
    - Configure and author advanced visualization techniques for maps and scenes. (Use [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) or [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) for visualization)
    - Understand and describe how a geolocator works. (Use [geocoder](https://geocoder.readthedocs.io/) for geocoding)
    - Use a network dataset to determine cost. (Use [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/) for network analysis)
    - Implement Python scripting using ArcPy. (ArcPy documentation available [here](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/arcpy/get-started/what-is-arcpy-.htm))
    - Author Arcade expressions. (Arcade expressions are typically written in ArcGIS Pro, no direct Python package but integrated into ArcGIS workflows)
    - Perform advanced vector and raster analysis. (Use [rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for raster data and [shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for geometric operations)
    - Understand geodatabase design and operate within a multiuser geodatabase. (Use [fiona](https://fiona.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for reading and writing spatial data formats)
    - Create, update, and delete features and attributes. (Use [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/) for spatial data management and operations)
    - Perform surface modeling and analysis. (Use [scipy](https://scipy.org/) for scientific computing and spatial interpolation)
    - Create and edit ModelBuilder models to automate complex workflows. (Use [arcpy](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/arcpy/get-started/what-is-arcpy-.htm) for geoprocessing automation)
    - Create, manage, and troubleshoot a mosaic dataset. (Use [gdal](https://gdal.org/) for geospatial data processing)
    - Configure the user interface and environment. (No direct Python package for UI configuration, but ArcGIS Pro supports Python scripts and ModelBuilder for automation)
    - Define and determine an appropriate spatial reference system (coordinate reference systems, datums, and projections). (Use [pyproj](https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/stable/) for spatial reference system transformations)
    - Author, share, and retrieve items from a portal. (Use [arcgis](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/) for interacting with the ArcGIS API for Python)
    - Use web content or services to perform analyses. (Use [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) for interacting with REST APIs and [arcgis](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/) for ArcGIS REST API access)
    - Author ArcGIS Pro Tasks. (ArcGIS Pro supports tasks but no direct Python package required)
    - Configure charts and infographics. (Use [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) or [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) for data visualization)
    - Configure map layouts and map series. (Use [folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) for interactive maps or [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) for advanced GIS data plotting)
    - Configure data schema and attributes. (Use [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/) to manage and configure spatial data schemas)
